Rhythmbox Ampache Plugin

= Disclaimer =

The original idea and code can be found here

   http://code.google.com/p/rhythmbox-ampache

However, development seemed to stop for Rhythmbox 3.

I completely rewrote the plugin and contributed a branch.
As I'm not one of owners I wasn't notified on new issues so I
decided to maintain the plugin here.

= Description =

The Rhythmbox Ampache Plugin is a plugin for the music player
Rhythmbox that enables browsing the metadata and streaming music
from an Ampache media server.

= Installation =

$ python setup.py install

= Usage =

On first run, the plugin needs to be configured in Rhythmbox via

   Configuration/Plugins

The Ampache plugin has the following Preferences:

   Server URL
   Username (optional)
   Password (Key)

If the plugin doesn't work as intended, additional debug
information can be acquired by running Rhythmbox in debug mode:

$ rhythmbox -D rhythmbox-ampache
